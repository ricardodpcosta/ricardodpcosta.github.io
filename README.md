*Welcome to my personal page*!

I am a post-doc researcher at University of Minho (in the beautiful city of Guimar√£es, Portugal) and a passionate about applied mathematics and scientific computing.

The research I conduct conderns the development of novel numerical methods in **finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin philosophy**, mainly with high-order of accuracy, focusing on the numerical and implementation challenges in high-performance computing platforms as well as their application in the fields of computational fluid dynamics and computational rheology.
