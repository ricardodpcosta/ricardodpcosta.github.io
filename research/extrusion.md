Under construction.


Several manufacturing technologies are used in the polymer processing industry to process thermoplastics, which mainly depend on the characteristics of the desired product, particularly on its geometry. Standard manufacturing technologies include the extrusion (pushing the molten polymer through a die), the injection moulding (injecting the molten polymer into a cavity), the extrusion


blow moulding (inflating a molten polymer tube inside a mould to create a hollow part), the 3D printing (depositing a molten polymer layer by layer to form the part), and the thermoforming (using suction to force a heated polymer sheet into a mould). A comprehensive literature on these manufacturing technologies and their application is found in M.G. McGrum et al., 1997 [2], D.M. Bryce, 1997--1999 [3--6], T.A. Osswald et al., 2006 [8], Z. Tadmor et al., 2006 [9], S. Thomas et al., 2009 [10], O.S. Carneiro et al., 2012 [11], and D.G. Baird et al., 2014 [12]. In the present work, a particular focus is provided for the extrusion process, which has a relevant role in nowadays polymer processing industry.
Constant cross-section items, such as tubing, sheets, films, and also structural components, such as profiles for window frames, are usually manufactured by extrusion. An illustration of a typical thermoplastic profile extrusion line is provided in Figure 1.3. The process is continuous and consists of an extruder, which comprises a screw rotating inside a heated barrel, and is gravity-fed with thermoplastic pellets from a top-mounted hopper, placed at the rear. The rotating screw compresses and forces the raw polymeric material to move forward through the barrel, in which several independently controlled heating units, mounted in sequence, gradually increase the temperature necessary for the melting. The viscous dissipation is another important thermodynamic phenomenon, responsible for generating the heat required to melt the polymer. However, it makes more difficult the temperature control and increases the risk of overheating. The extrusion die is mounted at the front of the barrel, and its cross-section corresponds to the desired product cross-section, through which the molten polymeric material, subject to compression, is forced to flow.




Polymer processing industries are highly sophisticated with advanced, expensive, and highly-automated manufacturing technologies.
However, the complex behaviour of polymers and the complex thermo-mechanical processes involved in these manufacturing technologies, raise challenging engineering problems, even for experienced polymer engineers.
Some of these challenges in the case of the extrusion are described hereafter.

The flow balance of the molten polymeric material at the die openings is crucial to avoid that more material flows through the thicker sections of the profile, when compared with the thinner ones~\cite{chap1:2017rajkumar}.
Therefore, an unbalanced flow does not allow to obtain the shape desired for the final solidified product, as exemplified in Figure~\ref{chap1:fig:polymer_processing_extrusion_deffects} for the case of a deck.
The usual practice to ensure a balanced flow consists in gradually adjusting the die geometry from the barrel to the openings, such that the thinner sections of the profile are compensated with more material.
However, due to the complex behaviour of the molten polymeric material, the effect of these adjustments in the flow is difficult to predict through pure analytic approaches mainly due to the large number of variables involved in the process.
On the other side, the common trial-and-error approach requires large amounts of resources, is very time-consuming, and might limit the possibility to achieve optimal configurations.
Indeed, the die design is a challenging task, even for experienced polymer engineers, leading to increased costs.

Another challenge of great concern in the extrusion, which also applies other different manufacturing technologies, is the cooling of the molten polymeric material after leaving the die~\cite{chap1:2017rajkumar}.
The cooling rate strongly determines the structure of the polymeric material and, thus, affects the physical properties of the final solidified product, such as density, optical and barrier properties, coefficient of friction, and impact behaviour.
In that regard, a high cooling rate is usually desired, particularly in the case of sheets and films, avoiding large crystallites and, consequently, providing smoothness and transparency.
Moreover, fast cooling is also desired for increasing the production and profitability of the process.
On the other side, the average temperature on the profile cross-section must fall below the solidification point of the polymeric material after the cooling stage.
Unfortunately, a high cooling rate might result in solidified borders and molten cores, especially in thicker sections, which might induce subsequent remelting of the product due to heat conduction.
Moreover, different cooling rates result in internal residual stresses, which also lead to subsequent deformation of the final solidified product.
In that regard, a uniform cooling rate is desired across the profile cross-section, which in general conflicts with a high cooling rate.

The previous challenge leads to an optimization problem, for which several parameters have to be considered, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{chap1:fig:polymer_processing_cooling_parameters}, namely, the extrusion conditions, cooling conditions, profile geometry, system geometry, polymer properties, metal properties (in the case of structural components), and the vacuum conditions (in the case of tubing and pipes), among others.
In the case of structural components, the optimization often consists in performing adjustments to the cooling/calibrator system geometry, configuration, or cooling conditions.
As in the previous case, the optimization problem is commonly performed with trial-and-error approaches implying the same drawbacks, which often leads to intractable challenges.
Similar challenges arise in the case of the injection moulding, where most of the residence time is dedicated to the cooling stage and, therefore, optimizing the heat transfer under the same principles is of crucial importance.

In light of the drawbacks of trial-and-error approaches in the context of these industry challenges, there is a deep concern for developing innovative and efficient alternative design approaches.
In that regard, the emerging field of computational modelling has received increasing attention from the industry side to provide means of overcoming these challenges and effectively support design activities.



Polymeric fluids exhibit complex viscoelastic behavior governed by nonlinear constitutive equations. Considering the full mathematical formulation is essential for accurately representing the behavior of these fluids. Numerical simulations with viscoelastic fluids can face stability and convergence challenges, especially when modeling real-world polymer processing test cases. To address these issues, a coupled solver for multi-mode viscoelastic flows was developed within the foam-extend framework, where pressure, velocity, and a selected viscoelastic mode are solved together in a single block system, while the remaining modes follow a segregated procedure. A key question is how to select the mode to include in the block system, as this choice can significantly affect both computational efficiency and solution accuracy. This study systematically investigates the impact of coupling each individual mode in a six-mode fluid. The results highlight how mode selection influences convergence time and overall solution quality. Additionally, a novel convergence assessment that was recently proposed is further tested. It is based on physical flow characteristics rather than solely on numerical residuals. Specifically, the variables such as total pressure drop and outlet flow distribution in three distinct zones evolution are tracked. This approach avoids inconsistencies caused by different residual normalizations in segregated and fully coupled solvers and provides a more reliable measure of convergence across various simulation strategies.



Polymer processing is crucial in many industries, from automotive to packaging, and is constantly present in so- ciety’s daily activities. Carefully establishing flow conditions and designing processing equipment is essential for cost-effectively producing high-quality plastic parts. In these scenarios, viscoelastic material models, which are the ones known to be more accurate in representing polymeric materials, can pose some challenges. Their behavior is governed by nonlinear equations for the stress tensor, and each additional mode demands solving six more hyperbolic equations [16]. Due to this complexity and demanding calculation, inelastic models are often used as approximations. However, they rarely capture the full complexity of real viscoelastic flows [2]. In practice, industries frequently resort to inelastic constitutive models, which can only partially capture the physics of these flows [30]. It is well known for a long time that for accurately modeling the behavior of melts, it is necessary to consider multiple modes, typically five or more, each adding six more partial differential equations to the system [6]. As a result, for instance, for a typical five modes material model, the computational effort escalates to solving 34 unknowns per computational cell (pressure, velocity components, and six stress components per mode). Moreover, the governing equations for the viscoelastic constitutive models are difficult to handle numerically, which poses additional solution difficulties .
Modeling viscoelastic flows is challenging due to the nonlinear nature of the governing equations, which include the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with hyperbolic viscoelastic constitutive models [22]. These equations describe the stress-strain relationship and necessitate solving additional differential equations alongside standard momentum and continuity equations. The high Weissenberg number problem (HWNP) leads to numerical instabilities and con- vergence difficulties, further complicating flow simulations [4, 10].
Several numerical approaches have been developed to address the complexities of viscoelastic flows, primarily categorized as segregated and coupled solvers.
Segregated solvers treat each governing equation separately and sequentially. The velocity and pressure fields are computed first, usually via projection methods like the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equa- tions) or PISO (Pressure-Implicit with Splitting of Operators) algorithm. The extra-stress tensor, which characterizes viscoelastic behavior, is then updated independently [6]. While this approach allows for efficient memory manage- ment, it faces stability issues at high Weissenberg numbers and often requires under-relaxation techniques to ensure convergence [7].

A main drawback of segregated solvers is the decoupling of velocity and stress fields, which can lead to unphysical results, especially in highly elastic flows. To mitigate this issue, stabilization techniques such as the log-conformation transformation [3, 7, 9] and the improved both-sides diffusion (iBSD) method [11] have been introduced. These methods enhance numerical robustness but do not fully resolve the limitations of segregated solvers, particularly in complex geometries and high elasticity.
To overcome these limitations, coupled approaches have been developed, where all governing equations are solved simultaneously within a single system. Coupled solvers provide better numerical stability and faster convergence rates by maintaining interdependencies between velocity, pressure, and stress fields throughout the solution process [12, 24, 27].
In classical CFD, coupled solvers have been effectively applied to Newtonian fluid flows, particularly in compress- ible aerodynamics and multiphase simulations [19, 29]. These methods utilize algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers and block matrix structures to efficiently manage large systems of equations resulting from discretized governing equations. However, extending these methods to viscoelastic fluids introduces additional challenges due to the highly nonlinear nature of viscoelastic constitutive equations.
Recent advancements have extended coupled solvers to viscoelastic flows, enabling the simultaneous solution of velocity, pressure, and stress fields. These approaches have shown significant improvements in stability and accuracy, particularly in benchmark cases like Poiseuille flow and contraction-expansion geometries [12, 24, 27].
Despite these advances, existing coupled solvers have primarily been limited to single-mode viscoelastic models, where the stress tensor is governed by a single relaxation time. While such models (e.g., the Oldroyd-B and Giesekus models) offer insights into viscoelastic behavior, they fail to capture the broad relaxation spectrum of real polymer melts, which exhibit multiple characteristic timescales [6].
Single-mode models are computationally convenient but lack the fidelity required for practical industrial applica- tions. Realistic viscoelastic fluids, such as molten polymers and biological fluids, require multimode models in which total stress is represented as the sum of several modes, each with distinct relaxation times. These multimode models better reflect experimental rheological data and are essential for accurately predicting flow behavior under complex processing conditions [6].
This work explores a novel coupled solver capable of handling multimode viscoelastic models, addressing the lim- itations of previous single-mode approaches, developed within the exaFOAM project [21, 25]. The proposed method integrates multiple relaxation times into the coupled solver framework, enabling accurate and stable simulation of complex viscoelastic flows encountered in industrial and scientific applications. The inclusion of multiple relaxation modes allows for better agreement with experimental rheological data and provides a more comprehensive under- standing of viscoelastic flow behavior in realistic settings.
This coupled solver for multimode viscoelastic flows was developed within the foam-extend distribution. In this, pressure, velocity, and a selected viscoelastic mode are solved together in a single block system, while the remaining modes follow a segregated procedure. A critical consideration is how to choose the mode to include in the block system, as this choice can significantly impact both computational efficiency and solution accuracy. The present study systematically investigates the effects of coupling each individual mode in a six-mode synthetic fluid, that is representative of realistic fluids. The results demonstrate how mode selection influences convergence time and overall solution quality. Furthermore, a novel convergence assessment based on physical flow characteristics—rather than solely on numerical residuals—proposed within the exaFOAM project [21, 25] is further assessed. This approach replaces differences in residual normalizations used to check for convergence in segregated and fully coupled solvers, providing a more reliable measure of convergence across different simulation strategies.
