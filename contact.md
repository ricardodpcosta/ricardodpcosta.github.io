## Graduate and doctoral students

<p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p>

Potential graduate and doctoral students interested in developing a master's dissertation or doctoral thesis on applied mathematics and scientific computing with applications in aerospace, manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical fields are invited to [contact me](mailto:rcosta@dep.uminho.pt). An intermediate to advanced understanding of fluid mechanics, numerical methods, and programming skills is recommended according to the study level.

Possible research topics range from applied mathematics to engineering applications, including:

- Numerical schemes design, analysis, and verification (both in space and time).
- Efficient data structures implementation for sparse matrix storage and manipulation.
- Code profiling and performance analysis in high-performance computing systems.
- Application to engineering problems involving fluids and solids mechanics.
