The research I have been conducting mainly concerns the development of novel numerical methods in **finite volume** and **discontinuous Galerkin philosophy** with high-order of accuracy, focusing on their numerical and implementation challenges in high-performance computing platforms as well as their application in the fields of **computational fluid dynamics** and **computational rheology.**
